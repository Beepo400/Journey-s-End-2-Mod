Major changes:
-Changed the initial BP count of travelers from 1 to 2. (!)
-Temporarily disabled encounters to facilitate a rework in the near-future.
-Started the process of simplifying dueled npcs. Much less duels should cause problems now.
-Blood buffer no longer restrains buffs. It instead inflicts a doom timer that must be removed by replacing the buffer. Doom timer is equal to the number of stacks.

Fixes:
-Fixed a few descriptions and names.
-Renamed Magical Medley (to prevent confusion with Magical Melody) and fixed it from targeting all allies and foes.
-Fixed several aspects of the Inventor job.
-Fixed a few shops having wrong or unpurchasable inventory and removed all info-based shop additions. (If you already had an info-based addition, they will not be removed on your save due to me only removing the trigger, not the flag.)
-Lowered the amount of soulstones needed for the window repair sidequest from 4 each to 1 each.
-Fixed a few (nowhere near all) broken NPC animations, and fixed the max boost sweeping gale U animation.
-Fixed the flee command. (Although it does nothing because encounters have been disabled...)
-Fixed Cold Cane being single target.
-Fixed an interaction where a traveler could use enhance-only abilities without an enhance effect if they were downed under specific circumstances and then revived.
-Fixed Solution 8 being incorrectly set to intensity-only.
-Fixed Immaterial Gambit not removing blue buffer as intended.

Ability Changes:
-Changed Immaterial Gambit so that it grants the party 2/4/6/8 stacks of blood buffer instead of permanent blood buffer.
-Chemical Fire now deals an additional hit of the dark element. This replaces it's additional hit at max boost.
-Freeze Dry now deals an additional hit of the wind element. This replaces it's additional hit at max boost.
-Ferromagnetism now deals an additional hit of the light element. This replaces it's additional hit at max boost.
-Lowered enemy counter damage and made it so cover works on their counters.
-Changed JP cost for character-specific divine skills from 300/1000 to 300/300, and corrected several characters having them at 0 cost.
-Slightly lowered the evade guard modifier that primarily affects Demon Dance abilities.

Other Changes:
-Changed it so you actually have to give Castti a grape like she asks instead of a raspberry.
-Slightly increased Crick and Emerald's base physical attack.
-Made the NPC in Southern Ku Sands that acts as an inn not vanish when Hikari's prologue is over, and positioned him over to a more obvious spot.
-Added a small amount of free-standing tender in most towns.
